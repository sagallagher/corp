Guidelines:
Each polytope must have a separate input document.
Each document must begin by listing the number of rows (i), followed by the number of columns (j) in the matrix.
After those two numbers are listed, the rest of the numbers will be read in as entries in an i by j matrix.

Currently, this project has the following input files:
24cell_facets.txt
120cell_facets.txt
600cell_facets.txt
dodecahedron_facets.txt
icosahedron_facets.txt

Dimensions provided by Tony Bedenikovic:
The dodecahedron has 12 facets, with 5 vertices on each.
The icosahedron has 20 facets, with 3 vertices on each.
The 24-cell has 24 facets, with 6 vertices on each.
The 120-cell has 120 facets, with 20 vertices on each.
The 600-cell has 600 facets, with 4 vertices on each.
