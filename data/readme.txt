Guidelines:
Each polytope must have a separate input document.
Each document contains entries in an i by j matrix.

Currently, this project has the following input files:
24cell_facets.txt
120cell_facets.txt
600cell_facets.txt
dodecahedron_facets.txt
icosahedron_facets.txt

Dimensions provided by Tony Bedenikovic:
The dodecahedron has 12 facets, with 5 vertices on each.
The icosahedron has 20 facets, with 3 vertices on each.
The 24-cell has 24 facets, with 6 vertices on each.
The 120-cell has 120 facets, with 20 vertices on each.
The 600-cell has 600 facets, with 4 vertices on each.
