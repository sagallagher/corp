Guidelines:
Each polytope must have a separate input document.
Each document must begin by listing the number of rows (i), followed by the number of columns (j) in the matrix.
After those two numbers are listed, the rest of the numbers will be read in as entries in an i by j matrix.

Currently, this project has the following input files:
24cell_facets.txt
120cell_facets.txt
600cell_facets.txt
dodecahedron_facets.txt
icosahedron_facets.txt
